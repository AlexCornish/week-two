Who pays for work to end up online? 
- Usually academic institutions, who get their funding for projects like this from grants from various foundations and councils. Occasionally, the projects will get funding from straight from academic institutions such as universities.
Who does the work? 
- Mostly volunteers through crowdsourcing do the work of transcribing the documents, whilst a couple of paid employees do the work of reviewing the work done by the volunteers and compiling of it all to make it available.  
What are some of the ethical dimensions of doing this work? 
- The bulk of the work is done by unpaid volunteers or in some cases, people made 0.05$ per amount of text transcribed, whilst presumably whoever is in charge of the project, gets both paid and the bulk of the credit for the project.       
- Possible exploitation of volunteers in terms of asking them to do more than they initially signed up for. 
Does Carleton give you any resources for getting those materials onto your own machine in formats you can read? 
- I have no idea, and I don't even know where I'd begin to look to find these resources. 
What are some of the barriers to accessing the resources that Carleton does make available to you? 
- The main barrier that I can think of is that I had no idea that there are resources available to me through Carleton, so maybe the lack of publicity to the students about this is a problem. 
Where do you fit into this digital history machine? 
- In the development of the technology used in digital history
