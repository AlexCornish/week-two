### Who pays for work to end up online? 
- Usually academic institutions, who get their funding for projects like this from grants from various foundations and councils. Occasionally, the projects will get funding from straight from academic institutions such as universities.
- Sometimes government departments/ government funded-organisations directly put the work online, like https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/ , which is a government website run by the National Records of Scotland. 
### Who does the work? 
- In some cases, it seems to be mostly volunteers or through crowdsourcing do the work of transcribing the documents, whilst a couple of paid employees do the work of reviewing the work done by the volunteers and compiling of it all to make it available.  
- Sometimes the work is done by archive and record professionals, but not many places have the resources to afford to pay for them to do this work.
### What are some of the ethical dimensions of doing this work? 
- The bulk of the work is done by unpaid volunteers or in some cases, people made 0.05$ per amount of text transcribed, whilst presumably whoever is in charge of the project, gets both paid and the bulk of the credit for the project.       
- Possible exploitation of volunteers in terms of asking them to do more than they initially signed up for. 
### Does Carleton give you any resources for getting those materials onto your own machine in formats you can read? 
- Initially, I had no idea of where I'd find these resources. However, upon further reflection, it became obvious that these resources would be available through the Macodrum Library's online portal and through searching their site, links to various subject's databases (https://library.carleton.ca/find/databases/subjects) and other documents through the regular search. 
### What are some of the barriers to accessing the resources that Carleton does make available to you? 
- The main barrier that I can think of is that I had no idea that these resources were available to me through Carleton, so maybe the lack of publicity to the students about this is a problem or it could just be a lack of awareness on my part. 
### Where do you fit into this digital history machine? 
- In the development of the technology used in digital history, most likely as I am currently working in Artificial Intelligence, albeit for different purposes than digital history, and I have a strong technical background.
